## Functionality
The code includes the necessary libraries and classes for trading, including Trade, Order, and PositionInfo. It defines constants and global variables, as well as a structure to store multiple algorithms.

### AddAlgorithm
The `AddAlgorithm` function allows the addition of a new algorithm to the system. It checks if the maximum number of algorithms has been reached and creates a new algorithm object, initializes its parameters and variables, and adds it to the array.

### OpenTrades
The `OpenTrades` function implements the logic to open trades based on the algorithms. It loops through each algorithm and executes the necessary code to calculate the lot size, stop loss, and take profit. It then opens trades using the calculated values.

### CloseTrades
The `CloseTrades` function implements the logic to close trades based on the algorithms. It loops through each algorithm and executes the necessary code to close trades associated with that algorithm.

### OnInit
The `OnInit` function is the entry point of the program. It initializes the necessary code, such as adding algorithms as examples. In this case, it adds two sample algorithms named 'Algorithm 1' and 'Algorithm 2'.

### OnTrade
The `OnTrade` function handles trade events. It checks if trading is allowed and calls the `OpenTrades` or `CloseTrades` functions accordingly.

### OnTick
The `OnTick` function handles tick events. It checks if trading is allowed and implements the logic to analyze ticks and update the algorithms.

### OnDeinit
The `OnDeinit` function handles the deinitialization of the program. It closes all trades associated with the algorithms.

### OnStart
The `OnStart` function is the main program logic, but it is currently empty in this code.

## Usage
To use this code, you can modify the algorithms, add more algorithms, or customize the trading logic based on your requirements. It is recommended to consult the official developer of AFM Pro Neural for a complete understanding of the software and its functionalities.

Please note that this code is provided as a sample and may require additional implementation and customization to work effectively in a real trading environment. It is recommended to test the code thoroughly in a demo account before using it with real funds.
